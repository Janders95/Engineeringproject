## Description
My project is a egg crusher. A bladed axe is placed on top of a box on a acrylic plate. When you hit the button it swings down and hits the egg which is on its own stand.

## Reflections
I suprising didn't expect to get this close to finishing the project. At first I struggled with this project but I started to catch on with what I want to complete.It felt weird doing a solo project but I enjoyed it. I had to do this faster since I left my last project due to the partner always being gone. I hope it works even if it puts a dent in it ill be fine with that. The biggest problem at first was a egg holder so I had to find one online that I liked the shaped of. The design overall was just inspired by them Medievel punishments you would see.
